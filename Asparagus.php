<h1 style="text-align:left">How to Grow Asparagus from Seed</h1>
<font color="blue">Asparagus seed sown in modules in the spring should germinate in about 2 to 3 weeks. F1 hybrid seed should give close to 100% germination.

About 3 weeks after germination when the asparagus seedlings are large enough, and have developed a strong root system, they should be transferred to 9 cm pots. Here the pots have been topped with vermiculite to discourage sciarid fly. Colour coded labels distinguish different varieties.

<br/>Orange = Thielim
<br/>Red = Guelph Millennium</font>

<img src="images/planted.jpg" class="magnify">After a further 7 weeks the young asparagus plants should have several shoots and will be ready to plant out into their final quarters.Asparagus plants need to be planted quite deeply to produce strong spears, but planting too deeply will reduce the yield. Here to young plants have been planted in shallow pits to avoid smothering the young fern. In the autumn, when the fern has died off, the asparagus bed will be smoothed over and built up further.By January the asparagus fern is mostly brown and dead. In spite of weeks of hard frost there is still an ocasional green stem, but it is time to cut it all away and tidy up the bed.

The end supports for the crop support system have to be substantial enough to hold a considerable weight of top growth. Asparagus shoots can easily reach five foot tall.</font>

A few spears have been harvested, but the emphasis has been on building the strngth of the crowns for next year.Male asparagus plants carry small bell shaped flowers.Female asparagus plants carry large numbers of round berries. These berries take a great deal of energy from the plants, weakening them and shortening their life. This is the principal reason why female asparagus plants are less productive than the males.

<img src="images/male_berry.jpg" class="magnify"><font color="#0000FF">Male asparagus plants can also produce berries from hermaphrodite flowers. The seed from these berries will give 25% female plants, 50% males and 25% supermales. The supermales can then be used to create new all male hybrids. The photo shows the berries on a plant of Gijnlim.</font>
